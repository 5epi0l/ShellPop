<h2>üíª Built with</h2>

Technologies used in the project:

*   Python 3

<h2>üîí SSL/TLS Encrypted Shells</h2>

ShellPop supports SSL/TLS encrypted reverse shells for enhanced security. The following shells are available:
* Python SSL
* Ruby SSL
* Node.js SSL

To use SSL/TLS encrypted shells:

<p>1. Generate a self-signed certificate (one-time setup):</p>

```
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
```

<p>2. For Python/Ruby shells, start the listener with:</p>

```
openssl s_server -quiet -key key.pem -cert cert.pem -port <PORT>
```

<p>3. For Node.js shells, use socat as the listener:</p>

```
socat openssl-listen:<PORT>,cert=cert.pem,verify=0 stdout
```

<p>4. Generate and use your SSL shell from ShellPop as normal, selecting one of the SSL options from the menu.</p>
